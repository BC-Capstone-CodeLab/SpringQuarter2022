# Project Name: CODELAB

## Description: Real-time code editor that allows multiple users to edit at the same time, and share the same view.

## Progress: The code editor synchronizes accross multple https sessions. However, for optimal result, only one user can edit at a time -- for now.

## Accomplishment: The results we have so far are in line with our milestore objectives. We set up an IDE, connect to a Firebase data, and learned about web-progammation (Javascript, NodeJs, Html, CSS).

## Future goals: We expect to implement a multi-user IDE and add a chat option. To do that we will explore Operational Transformation algorithms or Conflict-free Replication Data Type. We could use a library for the integrated chat app or build one from scratch with firebase.

External resources: The IDE was built using the [monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) API and the Github [judge0 project](https://github.com/judge0/ide). Of course we also used Firebase, NodeJS, Express, and SocketIO (to test the code locally).
